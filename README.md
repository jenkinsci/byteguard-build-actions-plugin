# ByteGuard-Jenkins
*ByteGuard adds a human verification step to your most consequential scripts. We use a mechanism similar to multifactor authentication for soliciting approval from team members before a function executes. This functionality can be used to safeguard against human error, workflow errors, and bugs in automation.*
